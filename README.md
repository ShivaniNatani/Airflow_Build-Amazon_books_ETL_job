## Project Overview
This project aims to extract data engineering books from Amazon, transform the data as needed, and load it into a PostgreSQL database using Apache Airflow.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12.7
- Apache Airflow
- PostgreSQL
- Requests (for web scraping)
- Beautiful Soup (for HTML parsing)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Airflow_Build-Amazon_books_ETL_job.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Airflow_Build-Amazon_books_ETL_job
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
5. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup
1. Set up PostgreSQL:
   - Install PostgreSQL and create a database.
   - Update the connection details in the Airflow configuration.

2. Configure Airflow:
   - Initialize the Airflow database:
     ```bash
     airflow db init
     ```
   - Start the Airflow web server and scheduler:
     ```bash
     airflow webserver --port 8080
     airflow scheduler
     ```

## Usage
1. Access the Airflow web interface at `http://localhost:8080`.
2. Trigger the ETL pipeline from the Airflow dashboard.

## Airflow DAG
- Explain the structure of the DAG.
- Provide a brief overview of the tasks involved:
  - **Extract**: Fetch data from Amazon.
  - **Transform**: Clean and format the data.
  - **Load**: Store the data in PostgreSQL.

## Data Storage
- Describe the schema of the PostgreSQL database.
- Mention any relevant tables and their structures.
